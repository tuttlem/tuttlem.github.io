# Introduction

In an attempt to put myself on an accelerated learning course about Rust, I've produced a number of articles in a 
"Learn Rust" series.

## Part 1-3: Core Concepts
These articles introduce you to Rust’s syntax, ownership model, and error handling, forming the essential foundation of Rust programming.

- [Part 1 - Language Basics]({% post_url 2024-10-29-learning-rust-part-1-language-basics %})
- [Part 2 - Memory Safety]({% post_url 2024-10-29-learning-rust-part-2-memory-safety %})
- [Part 3 - Error Handling]({% post_url 2024-10-29-learning-rust-part-3-error-handling %})

## Part 4-9: Advanced Language Features
Learn about Rust’s advanced features that make it unique, including concurrency, macros, generics, and more. These tools help you write safe, efficient, and reusable code.

- [Part 4 - Concurrency]({% post_url 2024-10-30-learning-rust-part-4-concurrency %})
- [Part 5 - Data Structures]({% post_url 2024-10-30-learning-rust-part-5-data-structures %})
- [Part 6 - Traits and Generics]({% post_url 2024-10-30-learning-rust-part-6-traits-and-generics %})
- [Part 7 - Macros and Metaprogramming]({% post_url 2024-10-30-learning-rust-part-7-macros-and-metaprogramming %})
- [Part 8 - Unsafe]({% post_url 2024-10-30-learning-rust-part-8-unsafe %})
- [Part 9 - Files and I/O]({% post_url 2024-10-30-learning-rust-part-9-files-and-io %})

## Part 10-13: Development Tools and Web Programming
This section explores Rust’s ecosystem for testing, package management, and web development, providing tools to help you maintain, extend, and deploy Rust applications.
