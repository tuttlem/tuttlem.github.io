### Introduction

The [find](https://linux.die.net/man/1/find) utility is an extremely flexible query tool for
your file system. It allows you to navigate and traverse your folder structures.

From the man page:

> This manual page documents the GNU version of find. GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each given file name by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side is false for and operations, true for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name.

In this article, we'll go through some usages.

#### Find by name

You can simply find by name with the `-name` switch:

{% highlight bash %}
find /the/directory -name the-file-name.txt
{% endhighlight %}

You can also ignore case by switching out `-name` for `-iname`.

#### Find by permissions

If you'd like to find files with a specific permission (in this case `777`):

{% highlight bash %}
find . -type f -perm 0777 -print
{% endhighlight %}

You can take the converse of this with `!`:

{% highlight bash %}
find . -type f ! -perm 0777 -print
{% endhighlight %}


#### Average file size

Let's say you have a directory of text files, and you'd like to find the average size of them.
By joining `find` with `awk`, you can use the following to do just that:

{% highlight bash %}
find . -type f -exec wc -w {} \; | awk '{numfiles=numfiles+1;total += $1} END{print total/numfiles}'
{% endhighlight %}

#### Random sampling

You may need to take a random sample of files in a given folder. You can start this process off
with `find`, and then through clever usage of `sort`, and `tail` you can get a random sample.

This will take 500 random files from a directory:

{% highlight bash %}
find /the/path -type f -print0 | sort -zR | head -zn 500
{% endhighlight %}

`find /the/path -type f -print0` prints out the files using `\0` as a delimiter thanks to `-print0`.

`sort` is told to use `\0` as its delimiter with `-z` and `-R` is to sort them randomly.

`head` now takes the first 500, again using `\0` as the delimiter.
