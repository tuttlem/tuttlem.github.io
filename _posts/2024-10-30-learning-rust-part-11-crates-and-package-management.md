# Introduction

Rust’s package manager, **Cargo**, provides an all-in-one toolset for building, dependency management, testing, and 
more. Beyond managing individual projects, Cargo also supports multi-package workspaces, making it ideal for complex 
Rust applications. With additional tools like **Clippy** for linting and **Rustfmt** for formatting, Cargo enables 
streamlined package development and code maintenance.

# Cargo Basics (Build System and Package Manager)

Cargo serves as Rust’s build system and package manager, handling tasks from project creation to compiling, testing, 
and managing dependencies. Each project includes a `Cargo.toml` file, which defines package metadata, dependencies, 
and configurations.

## Creating a New Project

To start a new Rust project, use `cargo new`, which sets up a folder with a `Cargo.toml` file, `src/main.rs` or 
`src/lib.rs`, and other necessary project files.

{% highlight bash %}
cargo new my_project --bin    # Creates a binary project
cargo new my_library          # Creates a library project
{% endhighlight %}

## Building and Running

Cargo provides commands for compiling and running Rust projects, ensuring an efficient development cycle.

{% highlight bash %}
cargo build           # Compiles the project
cargo run             # Builds and runs the project
cargo build --release # Builds an optimized release version
{% endhighlight %}

# Cargo Workspaces

Cargo workspaces allow you to manage multiple interdependent packages within a single project, making it easier to 
develop complex applications with multiple crates.

## Creating a Workspace

Define a workspace by creating a `Cargo.toml` at the project’s root and specifying member crates. Each member crate has 
its own folder with its own `Cargo.toml`.

{% highlight toml %}
# Cargo.toml
[workspace]
members = ["crate1", "crate2"]
{% endhighlight %}

With this setup, you can run `cargo build` or `cargo test` for all workspace members at once, simplifying multi-crate 
development.

# Dependencies and Versioning

Cargo simplifies dependency management with the `[dependencies]` section in `Cargo.toml`. You can specify dependencies 
by version, Git repository, or local path.

## Adding Dependencies

Add dependencies to `Cargo.toml`, and Cargo will download and build them automatically.

{% highlight toml %}
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"                      # Version from crates.io
rand = { version = "0.8" }         # Alternate syntax for version
my_local_crate = { path = "../my_local_crate" } # Local dependency
{% endhighlight %}

## Semantic Versioning

Cargo follows semantic versioning (`major.minor.patch`) for specifying compatible versions.

{% highlight toml %}
serde = "1.0"  # Compatible with 1.0 or higher, but below 2.0
serde = "~1.0" # Compatible with 1.0.x only
{% endhighlight %}

# Publishing to Crates.io

Publishing a crate to **crates.io** makes it available to the Rust community. To publish, create an account on 
crates.io and generate an API token.

## Steps to Publish

1. **Update `Cargo.toml`**: Include essential information like name, description, license, and repository link.
2. **Login and Publish**: Use `cargo login` with your API token, then `cargo publish` to upload the crate.

{% highlight bash %}
cargo login <API_TOKEN>
cargo publish
{% endhighlight %}

## Versioning for Updates

After publishing, increment the version in `Cargo.toml` before publishing updates. Follow semantic versioning rules for 
breaking changes, new features, and patches.

{% highlight toml %}
version = "1.1.0" # Update for new features
{% endhighlight %}

## Rust Toolchain Management (rustup and cargo-install)

Rustup manages Rust’s toolchain, making it easy to install, update, or switch between versions. Rustup supports stable, 
beta, and nightly versions of Rust.

## Using Rustup

{% highlight bash %}
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Update Rust
rustup update

# Switch to the nightly toolchain
rustup default nightly
{% endhighlight %}

## Installing Packages Globally with `cargo install`

`cargo install` allows you to install Rust binaries globally, useful for tools like Clippy or custom Rust tools from 
GitHub.

{% highlight bash %}
cargo install ripgrep     # Install ripgrep, a fast search tool
cargo install cargo-edit  # Install a cargo subcommand from GitHub
{% endhighlight %}

## Clippy for Linting

Clippy is Rust’s linter, designed to catch common mistakes, stylistic issues, and potential bugs. Run Clippy with 
`cargo clippy`, and it will analyze your code for possible improvements.

## Using Clippy

If Clippy isn’t already installed, add it as a component.

{% highlight bash %}
rustup component add clippy
cargo clippy
{% endhighlight %}

Clippy provides suggestions with severity levels like “warning” and “help,” encouraging idiomatic and optimized Rust 
code. For instance, Clippy might recommend avoiding redundant clones or inefficient operations.

# Rustfmt for Code Formatting

Rustfmt automatically formats Rust code according to Rust’s style guide, ensuring consistency across the codebase. 
Rustfmt is especially useful in collaborative projects and CI pipelines.

## Formatting with Rustfmt

Run Rustfmt with `cargo fmt` to format your code in place, following Rust’s official style guide.

{% highlight bash %}
rustup component add rustfmt
cargo fmt
{% endhighlight %}

Rustfmt can also be customized with a `.rustfmt.toml` file, where you can set options for indentation, line width, and 
more.

{% highlight toml %}
# .rustfmt.toml
max_width = 100  # Set max line width
hard_tabs = false
{% endhighlight %}

## Summary

Rust’s Cargo package manager and associated toolchain provide an efficient approach to project management, dependency 
handling, and distribution. Cargo workspaces simplify managing multi-crate projects, while tools like Clippy and Rustfmt 
maintain code quality and style. With support for publishing and version control, Cargo and Rust’s ecosystem streamline 
the development, distribution, and maintenance of reliable Rust projects.
